A **Dutch auction** for selling tokens should follow these **correct dynamics**:

### 1. **Auction Initialization**
   - **Seller specifies:**
     - **Total supply** of tokens to sell.
     - **Starting price** per token.
     - **Discount rate** (how much the price decreases per unit of time).
     - **Auction duration** (fixed period after which the auction ends).
   - **Auction price should always decrease linearly** over time.

### 2. **Price Decline Mechanism**
   - The **price per token starts high** and **gradually decreases** over time.
   - Formula:
     \[\text{current price} = \max(\text{starting price} - (\text{discount rate} \times \text{time elapsed}), \text{reserve price}) \]
   - A **reserve price (floor price)** can be set to prevent selling below a certain threshold.

### 3. **Bidding Process**
   - Buyers **can purchase at any time** by submitting payment at the current price.
   - The buyer **receives a quantity of tokens** based on how much they pay:
     \[
     \text{tokens received} = \frac{\text{ETH paid}}{\text{current price per token}}
     \]
   - **If the buyer overpays**, excess ETH is refunded.

### 4. **Auction Ends When:**
   - **Time expires** (remaining tokens may not be sold).
   - **All tokens are sold** before expiration.

### 5. **Settlement**
   - Tokens are transferred to buyers **immediately** upon purchase.
   - ETH proceeds go to the seller.
   - If unsold tokens remain, the seller can **choose to reclaim or relist them**.

### ðŸ”¥ Key Considerations for a Well-Designed Dutch Auction
1. **Fair Pricing Dynamics** â€“ The price should decrease smoothly and not reach zero before the auction ends.
2. **Efficient Purchase Mechanism** â€“ Buyers should be able to purchase multiple tokens in a single transaction.
3. **Refunds for Overpayment** â€“ If the buyer sends more ETH than required, refund the excess.
4. **Prevent Front-running** â€“ Use mechanisms like a **grace period** before price updates or batch processing.
5. **Ensuring Finality** â€“ The auction should properly handle **unsold tokens**.
